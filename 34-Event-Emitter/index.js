/**
 *  ðŸŒ³ There are 2 Important things in Mongoose
 *    ---------------------------------------------------
 *      1) Schema
 *      2) Model
 * 
 *   1) Schema : The no of field inside a collection of a db is a  Schema. We 
 *               usually do this to apply validation on any field.
 * 
 *   2) Model :  Model use that schema to connect mongodb and NodeJs.
